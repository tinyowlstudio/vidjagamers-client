# Vidja Gamers App
This is an app that will allow users to view video games. They can register, login, and manage their user info and their favorite video games. Games themselves have a descriptions on the video game itself, including developers, release year, and genres. A search function is also included to help users filter and find the game they want to look at and add or remove from their favorites list. 

User and game info are stored on an API, and the app itself accesses said API so long as a JWT token is correct. Passwords are also encrypted on the API. The two databases were made specifically for this app.

**To view the API, go to this repository: https://github.com/tinyowlstudio/game_api**

## Current bugs/issues
- Handle CORS issue in which specified URLs are causing issues (to allow the removal of using all origins)

## Possible Future Updates
- Increase game library to be more substantial OR use another Game API that already has a library of games
    - If using a different Game API, app functionality will need to be adjusted
- Work on branding and visual design of the app
- Add a featured/all games filter
- Add pagination for a list of games greater than 10-20 (testing will need to be done to see what number works best)
- Possibly a better list sorting mechanism (ie, listed games in a series should be by date)
- Add roll over for descriptions of developers and genres
- Allow users to click developers, series, genres, platforms and year to see a full list of games with the same field
